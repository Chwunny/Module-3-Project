- How does the internet work?
    The internet is a global network of billions of computers and electronic devices. 
    A network is a set of computer that can intercommunicate. The internet is made up of smaller local networks.
    Because of this, there is a essentially an infinite amount of information accessible through the internet.
    The web and internet are different, the web is a way to view and share information over the internet.

- What happens when you click a link?
    When you click on a link your browser takes that URL and breaks it into smaller pieces. Protocol, hostname, port, and resource.
    It uses these smaller pieces to get an IP address for the website the link is associated with. Your browser then opens a TCP connection to the site over Internet Protocol. It speaks to the HTTP server to get the web page in HTML which it then renders. 
    This all happens in a matter of seconds or even milliseconds.
